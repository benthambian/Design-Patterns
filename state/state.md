## State

The State Pattern provides a way to handle state transitions of a complex object due to different operations.
Unlike the primitive and simple implementation of operations which handle state transitions straight forward, 
the state pattern provides more strong scalabily and makes it more easier to manage the state transitions.

The abstract class diagram is below.

If we try to solve similar problems with the state pattern, we need first define the concrete states and the operations leading to state transitions.
