This repository collects implements for common design patterns. Unlike others, the implements are best practices from work, and more comprehensive.

This pattern provides a simple way to describe _**tree-like**_ structures, for example, menu which has sub-menus \(nodes\) and menu items \(leaves\). It helps us to characterize the relationship between the whole and the part.
