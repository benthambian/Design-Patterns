# Design-Patterns

This repository collects implements for common design patterns. Unlike others, the implements are best practices from work, and more comprehensive.

## [Composite](/composite/composite.md)

This pattern provides a simple way to describe _**tree-like**_ structures, for example, menu which has sub-menus \(nodes\) and menu items \(leaves\). It helps us to characterize the relationship between the whole and the part.

## [State](/state/state.md)

The State Pattern provides a way to handle state transitions of a complex object due to different operations. Unlike the primitive and simple implementation of operations which handle state transitions straight forward, the state pattern provides more strong scalabily and makes it more easier to manage the state transitions.
